Simple Python Libs to gather information from web appis or bitcoind and generate different stats

Use the source luke!

Running the file should produce simple results.

bitcoin.py - Pulls data from API sources
- I never intended to relase the code, so I didn't note where some came from. 
- In my google search, I should mention the following:
- https://github.com/nanotube/supybot-bitcoin-marketmonitor/blob/master/BitcoinData/plugin.py#L58

bitcoin2.py - Pulls data from Bitcoind
- bitcoin2.py makes use of: https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin-python
- Most of the calculations comes from https://github.com/lirazsiri/blockexplorer/blob/master/htdocs/includes/app_stats.inc
